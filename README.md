#.NET MVC Playground
---

I started my development career in the .NET world, I wanted to see what was up
with all the new cross platform .NET tooling.


Specifically, this is a very lightweight .NET API. The only thing here aside
from raw C# is some database bindings from Entity Framework.


This was built on Arch Linux using the Mono Framework.
